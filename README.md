# reinforced-concrete
Package to design the cross-section of Reinforced Concrete Structures. This includes a set of functions related to the problem of finding the equilibrium of a reinforced concrete cross-section when submitted to some loading (N, M_x, M_y), typically involving optimization of nonlinear functions. This codes were first developed during the Reinforced Concrete Class at ITA in 2014 and 2015 (called "EDI-38: Concreto Estrutural I").
